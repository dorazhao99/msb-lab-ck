# Giving HCI Research Elevator Pitch 

### Tips
- The goal of an elevator pitch from the faculty-side / person who receives the pitch is to have something they can "anchor on" that identifies the person (author of a paper, person that does a certain thing)
- Think about what you want the person to remember about you (could hook into existing work of yours that is well-known)
- More effective if it is something that uniquely defines you / what people remember about you
- Don't tune your pitch too much to the audience (for example when you go on the job market you put out a single version of yourself so they need to make the connection)
- Start with a high-level description of your work (e.g., "I do social computing design work") and then focus on a project (e.g., something specific like what are the first couple paragraphs of what the paper intro will look like)
- Good to think about your impact-maximizing project (what do you want people to remember you for in terms of research either something).
- Don't weave all your research together, just pick a thing
- 

### Rough Template of a Pitch 
```
I work on [your theme in one sentence only].

[Recently | right now], I am working on...[two sentences on a particular project that is your most impactful
or will be most impactful in the future.]

[We're finding | we are able to...] [give the "kicker" or interesting thing you can do]

We're excited that this could... [if you have time, give the "so what"] 
```
