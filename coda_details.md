Recycling,Compost and Trash Stanford is on the path to zero waste, defined as 90% waste reduction or more, by 2030. To achieve this goal and to increase access to recycling and composting, the waste system has been updated in all buildings across campus.
 
To meet the campus waste standards, the new CoDa building will include:
Shared waste stations - individuals are responsible for sorting deskside waste at a shared waste station, located in common areas throughout the building. Shared waste stations will be serviced daily by custodians and deskside bins will only be provided upon request.
Streamlined recycling - all recyclable material will be collected together in the blue bin (combining paper, cardboard, plastics, metal, and glass). Flattened cardboard can be placed in or next to a shared station in your building.
Compost collection - food scraps, paper towels, and compostable food serviceware will be collected in green bins daily in break rooms, kitchens, and in restrooms.
The elements of the new Zero Waste Building System are critical to:
Modernize Stanford’s buildings with shared waste stations that help reduce materials going to landfill and avoid emissions that contribute to climate change
Comply with new state laws regulating recycling and composting
Continue Stanford’s leadership in sustainability and zero waste

Recycling Bins are located in CoDa kitchens, common spaces, and in all mtg rooms.  
Cardboard can be placed outside your office.  Custodial personnel will collect them for recycling.




Electrical outlets in offices:
To comply with the California Title 24 Building Energy Efficiency Standards, many of the offices have both switched and unswitched outlets.  The unswitched outlets are energized 24x7.  The switched outlets (seen on the right side in the picture below) are controlled by the motion sensor in the room and will turn off after a period of no activity.  People in offices where desks have been shifted should plug in their computers and other equipment that charge or need constant power should be using the outlets on the left side.  Most desks have three outlets on the underside of the desk and three outlets and two USB ports on the desktop so plug strips and extension cords should not be needed.





Health and Safety:
First aid kits will be located in every kitchen in CoDa (on order)

Automatic External Defibrillators (AED) Location: 1st floor lobby next to elevator lobby. 

ADA Emergency Call buttons: installed outside the elevator lobbies on the basement level through 4th floors and are for emergency use only.   In the event of a fire alarm, the elevator automatically gets recalled to the first floor.  If a disabled person is unable to reach the 1st floor, then the button will call 911 to provide a location to emergency responders of the person who is unable to exit the building









Emergency Assembly Point (EAP) Location: Southeast side on the corner of Jane Stanford Way and Lomita Mall in case of a building evacuation. (see picture)
