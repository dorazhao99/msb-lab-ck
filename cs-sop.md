## Tips
- Common mistakes we see in a statement of purpose are long-form versions of a resume. SOPs should contain new information, ideally that conveys initiative and creativity. Rather than explaining a project they worked on, the applicant should describe how they contributed to it, what they learned from their experience, and how it prepares them for graduate school.
- The strongest SOPs also describe an applicant’s research agenda. We all know this may change over the course of grad school, but applicants should have some idea of what they want to study coming in.
- An SOP is an opportunity for an applicant to brag about themself and their accomplishments. If you think a student is underselling or skimming over some of the amazing things they’ve done, encourage them to tell you more.
- SOPs should be clear and concise

## Structuring an SOP
- A common structure for an SOP starts with an introduction of your research experiences and summarize your main contributions. Then, talk about 2-3 projects / research experiences that the student has. The SOP should conclude with a forward-looking section where the student discusses what they are interested in researching during their PhD, identity faculty at the school the student is interested in working with during their PhD, and briefly discuss post-PhD goals. 
- The introduction helps set up why the student is interested in doing a PhD.
- Sample Intro:
  ```
  As a researcher, my interests are oriented toward mitigating algorithmic bias and better
  understanding machine learning fairness. Currently, I am an AI Engineer at COMPANY working on TEAM.
  Prior, I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s in Computer Science at SCHOOL where I had the opportunity
  to work on projects related to fairness in computer vision systems and social computing.
  Overall, the goal of my research is to create more equitable AI systems. 
  ```
- When discussing research projects, clearly describe your research problem, specific contributions (be technical) and research outcomes to demonstrate your knowledge in the field. SoP should also reflect on what the student learned from the research project, such as what they learned as a person / researcher, how this experience prepared them for graduate school, etc.
- It is good to mention around 2-4 faculty that the student is interested in working with. The student should include a sentence justifying why they are interested in working with that faculty member. Try to be specific. Example:
```
At _____, I am interested in Prof. _____’s work on systematically designing processes for human-AI interaction,
such as the extensive work he has done on crowdsourcing. Since I have worked with crowdsourcing for several projects,
I am interested in how to improve this process through not only developing heuristics to capture human judgment but
also ensuring we are limiting human bias during the collection process. I also admire the work Prof. _____ has done
in the AI fairness space, especially integrating social science methods in machine learning. Finally, I am interested in
Prof. _____’s work on developing fair and robust methods for machine learning across the pipeline,
from documentation for dataset creation to evaluation metrics for diversity and inclusion. 
```
- At the end of the SOP, it is also common to have a sentence or two about future goals / what the student wants to do after grad school.
