Formal Foundations. Courses in this group emphasize mathematics and formal reasoning as it applies to foundational questions about computation. Available courses:
- CS166, CS168, CS261, CS263, CS264, CS265
- CS154, CS254, CS254B, CS354
- CS205L, CS334A, EE276, EE364A, EE364B, CS369O
- CS225, CS229M, CS328
- CS157, Phil251, CS257, CS258
- CS250, CS255, CS256, CS259Q, CS269I, CS355, CS359D 

Learning and Modeling. Courses in this group seek to build models of observed phenomena. They emphasize building these models from data, with the goal of predicting, classifying, or otherwise structuring observations. Available courses:
- CS221, CS222, CS223A, CS224N, CS224R, CS224S, CS224U, CS 224V, CS224W, CS227B, CS228, CS229, CS229M, CS231A, CS231N, CS233, CS234, CS236, CS237A, CS237B, CS281
- CS205L, CS230, CS330, CS331, CS332, CS333
- CS326, CS329A, CS329D, CS329H, CS329T CS329X, CS336
- CS248A, CS248B, CS348A, CS348B, CS348C, CS348E, CS348I, CS348N
- CS271, CS272, CS273A, CS273B, CS274, CS279, CS371, CS373, CS375

Systems. Courses in this group explore the construction of computing artifacts that meet design constraints or requirements. They emphasize not only what we build, but how we build it and the challenges in doing so. Problems in this area often, but not always, include performance (speed, memory, energy), scalability, tradeoffs, complex software, and considering the quality of the artifact itself in addition to its capabilities. Available courses:
- EE180, EE282, EE382E, CS149, CS316
- CS112, CS140E, CS212, CS217, CS229S, CS 240, CS240LX
- CS143, CS243
- CS144, CS244, CS244B
- CS145, CS245, CS246, CS251
- CS155, CS356
- CS242, CS358
- CS249I
- CS348K

People and Society. Courses in this group examine how computing and technology affect and interact with humans and societies, seeking to place artifacts in the context in which they are used. In particular, this area will include courses that deal with the societal impact of computation and HCI courses. Available courses:
- CS 125, 147, 148, 152, 181, 182, 194H, 206, 207, 224C, 247 A/B/C/... SERIES, 256, 269I, 278, 281, 293, 323, 324H, 329H, 329R, 329T, 329X, 337, 347, 377 A/B/C/... SERIES, 384, 448B, 470
